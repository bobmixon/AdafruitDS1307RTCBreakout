# AdafruitDS1307RTCBreakout
This workspace contains various examples of how to use the Adafruit DS1307 RTC breakout board with different micro-controllers and development platforms.

## Development Platforms Directory Structure: 
* [aide](https://github.com/bobmixon/AdafruitDS1307RTCBreakout/tree/master/aide) = Arduino IDE
* [pio](https://github.com/bobmixon/AdafruitDS1307RTCBreakout/tree/master/pio) = PlatformIO

I personally use VSCode with PlatformIO for my development. However, many don't that's why I've included the Arduino IDE development platform.


# Code Documentation
I have written an article on my blog that provides detailed information about this code.
