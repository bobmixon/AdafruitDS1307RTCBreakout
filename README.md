# AdafruitDS1307RTCBreakout
This workspace contains various examples of how to use the Adafruit DS1307 RTC breakout board with different micro-controllers and development platforms.

Development Platforms Directory Structure: 
aide = Arduino IDE, pio = PlatformIO

I personally use VSCode with PlatformIO for my development. However, many don't that's why I've included the Arduino IDE development platform.
