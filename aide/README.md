# Arduino IDE Examples
The examples in this folder are specifically for the Arduino IDE. Each sub-folder, such as ArduinoUNO, has the code for working with the Adafruit DS1307 RTC breakout and Arduino UNO.

If you are looking for examples using PlatformIO, please see the sibling [pio](https://github.com/bobmixon/AdafruitDS1307RTCBreakout/tree/master/pio) folder.

# Examples
* [ArduinoUNO](https://github.com/bobmixon/AdafruitDS1307RTCBreakout/tree/master/aide/ArduinoUNO) - Using an Arduino UNO, this code displays DS1307 RTC values in the serial terminal window.
